# This is a simple Task Management Application built with React.

This is a Task Management Application built as part of the Frontend Developer Assessment for RegisterKaro. The application allows users to manage tasks with features like creating, updating, deleting, sorting, and filtering tasks.

## Features 
- Add, Update, and Delete Tasks
- Mark Tasks as Complete or Incomplete
- Filter Tasks by status (All, Completed, Incomplete).
- Sort Tasks by creation date.
- Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile and desktop.
- Routing: Includes a Task Details page displaying task information in a table format.
- Persistence: Tasks are stored in local storage for data retention.

## Live Demo ðŸš€ 

The application is deployed and can be accessed at: https://taskmanager987.netlify.app/


## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Rupendra987/task_management.git
   cd task_management_app
2. Install dependencies:
  npm install
3. Start the application:
  npm start   

## Tools and Libraries

1. Frontend: React.js, React Router, PropTypes
2. Styling: CSS (Responsive Design)
3. State Management: React's useState and useEffect hooks
4. Testing: Jest and React Testing Library

 ## Thought Process
 
 State Management: Tasks are managed using React's useState and updated dynamically on user actions.
 Component Design: Modular components ensure reusability and maintainability.
 Routing: React Router is used to navigate between the Home Page and Task Detail Page.
 Responsiveness: CSS ensures the app works seamlessly across devices.
 Code Quality: PropTypes validates props to prevent runtime errors.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
